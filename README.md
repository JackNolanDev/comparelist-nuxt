# Compare-list

This is a service for comparing different best selling lists. This is the backend server for the website: [https://comparelist.github.io](https://comparelist.github.io).

This service uses NYTime's Books API to get their bestseller information and then webscrapes other services which do not provide more convenient developer access.
